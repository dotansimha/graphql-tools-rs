## `graphql-tools` (Rust)

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/graphql-tools) | [Crate](https://crates.io/crates/graphql-tools) | [GitHub](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-tools-rs)

The [`graphql_tools` crate](https://crates.io/crates/graphql-tools) implements tooling around GraphQL for Rust libraries. Most of the tools are based on `trait`s and `struct`s implemented in [`graphql_parser` crate](https://crates.io/crates/graphql-parser).

The goal of this library is to create a common layer of tools that has similar/improved APIs to [`graphql-js` reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) and [`graphql-tools` from the JS/TS ecosystem](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools).

### Getting Started

![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/graphql-tools?label=graphql-tools%20%28crates.io%29)

Add `graphql-tools` as a dependency of your project by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
graphql-tools = "..."
```

Or, if you are using [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit):

```
cargo add graphql-tools
```

By default, this crate is using the [`graphql-parser`](https://github.com/graphql-rust/graphql-parser) library for parsing. If you wish to use an alternative implementation such as [`graphql-hive/graphql-parser-hive-fork`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-parser-hive-fork), use the following `features` setup:

```toml
[dependencies]
graphql-tools = { version = "...", features = "graphql_parser_fork", default-features = false }
```
